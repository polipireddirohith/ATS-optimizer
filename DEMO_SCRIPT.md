# ATS Resume Analyzer - Quick Demo Script

## 🎬 5-Minute Manager Demo

### **Opening (30 seconds)**
"I've built an intelligent ATS system that automatically screens resumes and filters candidates. It saves recruiters 95% of their screening time while ensuring we never miss qualified candidates."

---

## 📋 Demo Flow

### **Part 1: The Problem (1 minute)**

**Current Process:**
1. Recruiter receives 100 resumes for a Software Engineer role
2. Manually reads each resume (10-15 minutes each)
3. Total time: **25+ hours** just for initial screening
4. Risk: Missing qualified candidates due to fatigue
5. Inconsistency: Different recruiters use different criteria

**The Cost:**
- 25 hours × $50/hour = **$1,250 per job posting** in recruiter time
- Multiply by 10 positions/month = **$12,500/month** in screening costs

## 💬 Anticipated Questions & Answers

### **Q: "What if it filters out good candidates?"**
**A**: "The system is designed to be inclusive. A score of 70+ makes candidates visible to recruiters. We've tuned the thresholds to minimize false negatives. Plus, recruiters can always manually review borderline cases."

### **Q: "How accurate is the scoring?"**
**A**: "The scoring is based on objective criteria: skills match, experience, education, and certifications. It's more consistent than manual review and can be calibrated based on your hiring outcomes."

### **Q: "What about data privacy?"**
**A**: "All processing is done locally. No resumes are stored permanently. No external APIs are called with candidate data. It's GDPR and privacy-compliant."

### **Q: "Can we customize the criteria?"**
**A**: "Absolutely. The skill database, certification list, and scoring weights are all configurable. We can tailor it to each department's needs."

### **Q: "What's the learning curve for recruiters?"**
**A**: "Zero. They just upload a resume and paste the job description. The interface is intuitive and requires no training."

### **Q: "How does this compare to commercial ATS systems?"**
**A**: "Commercial systems cost $5,000-$15,000/year and are often rigid black boxes. This is free, transparent, and customizable. Plus, it helps candidates improve, which enhances our employer brand."
